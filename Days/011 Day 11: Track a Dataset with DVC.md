# Day 11: Track a Dataset with DVC

A teammate has added the transactions dataset to the xFusionCorp Industries fraud-detection repository, but it was committed directly to Git instead of being tracked with DVC. Bring the repository in line with the team standard—every dataset under data/ must be tracked by DVC, not by Git.


A project exists at /root/code/fraud-detection/ with DVC already initialised. The dataset data/raw/transactions.csv is currently tracked by Git, and the team standard requires DVC to own it instead.


Stop Git from tracking the dataset without deleting it from disk.


Track the same dataset with DVC so a .dvc pointer file is produced and data/raw/.gitignore excludes the dataset itself.


Stage the new .dvc pointer and the new .gitignore, then record a Git commit with the message Track transactions dataset with DVC.


Once tracking is moved to DVC, the DVC TRACKED section in the EXPLORER panel will list the dataset, confirming the extension recognises it as a DVC-managed file.

### SOLUTION
- In the terminal change to the directory
```bash 
cd /root/code/fraud-detection
```


- Remove the dataset from git tracking but keep it the file in the disk
```bash
git rm --cached data/raw/transactions.csv
```

- Track and manage the dataset with DVC 
```bash
dvc add data/raw/transactions.csv
```

- Git add & git commit ----> records the DVC tracking configuration in Git

```bash
git add data/raw/transactions.csv.dvc data/raw/.gitignore

git commit -m "Track transactions dataset with DVC"
```
