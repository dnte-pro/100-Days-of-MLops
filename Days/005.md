# Day 4: Create a Standard ML Project Structure

A colleague has started a new ML project at /root/code/fraud-detection/, 
but the layout does not match the xFusionCorp Industries standard. 
Bring the project in line with the team's conventions. Inspect the existing project at /root/code/fraud-detection/.
The final layout must match the tree below exactly: 

fraud-detection/ 

├── data/ 

│ ├── raw/ 

│ └── processed/ 

├── models/ 

├── notebooks/ 

├── src/ 

│ ├── data/ 

│ ├── features/ 

│ ├── models/ 

│ └── utils/ 

├── tests/ 

├── configs/ 

├── requirements.txt 

└── README.md 


Every subdirectory under src/ must contain an __init__.py file so that Python recognises it as a package. 
requirements.txt must list the following dependencies, one per line: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, and mlflow. 
The canonical PyPI name for the scikit-learn package is scikit-learn. README.md must begin with the heading # fraud-detection.
Review the existing project and correct everything that does not match the requirements above.



# Solution 
**NB:** the requirements.txt file should contain 
- scikit-learn and not sklearn 
- pandas
- numpy
- mlflow


Ensure that the folder is as stated in the instructions(To be on the safe side you can delete the folder and manually create the folders and the files.)
- Edit the README.md to have ``` # fraud detection ```
